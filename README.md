# NARW_MutationLoad
This project: to quantify and characterize patterns of neutral and deleterious genetic variation across three species of Balaenidae whale with different recovery histories post-commercial whaling.

Both command line and R scrips (used for plotting and statistical analyses) are included. 

Note that data were independently analyzed for the autosomes and X chromosomes. Seperate command line scripts will be available for each genomic region.

Scripts are also divided by interspecific and NARW-specific analyses.


*apologies for the mess. Feel free to contact @ richard.orton@smu.ca with any questions.
