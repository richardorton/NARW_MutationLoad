# NARW_MutationLoad
This project: to quantify and characterize patterns of neutral and deleterious genetic variation across three species of Balaenidae whale with different recovery histories post-commercial whaling.

Both command line and R scrips (used for plotting and statistical analyses) are included. 

Note that data were independently analyzed for the autosomes and X chromosomes. Seperate command line scripts will be available for each genomic region.

Scripts are also divided by interspecific and NARW-specific analyses.

Note that not all code was used in the respective manuscript. For example, GERP scores were not used because the scores were not available for the most recent verstion of the blue whale reference genome. 

Code that was included in our scripts but was not used for the manuscript were exploratory. For instance, we briefly tested to see if GERP scores varied across the mutation impact categories predicted by SnpEff. They did not.
